          Document Retriver combines machine learning with intelligent information extraction to provide a fast,       easy-to-use platform to handle all your businessâ€™ documents in one place.
         With a tailor-made pathfinder solution, documents can be sorted and indexed into an intelligent database,

          <ModalContent>
          The user enters a query to search for documents. The query may be simple (eg. "travel") or complex (eg. "how to apply for parental leave?").
          The relevant documents are retrieved, and the results are displayed in a clear, easy to read manner.
          When applicable a snippet of relevant document content is displayed.
      </ModalContent>
      <br/>
      <Image className='image' src={Img1}/>
      <br/>
      <ModalContent>
        If required, or the initial query was very broad (e.g. "manual"), the user can further refine searches using document categories.
        Categories are listed down the left hand side, with a number indicating the number of relevant results within that category.
          </ModalContent>
          <br/>
          <Image className='image' src={Img2} />
          <br/>
          <ModalContent>Multiple filters can be chosen, and they are applied in conjunction.
       </ModalContent>
       <br/>
       <Image className='image' src={Img3} />
       <br/>
       <ModalContent>
        Powerful spellchecking techniques are employed, attempting to ensure the user is never left at a dead end.
       If a search results in no results, the best suggestion is automatically searched and returned.
        </ModalContent>
